# Job Listing Site Project 
This is a job listing site where companies are able to sign up and post their job offers and potential employees are able to browse and search for specific job offers. I also implemented a direct messaging feature between regular users and companies.

In this project I implemented and learned about CRUD operations, user login and registration, authentication and authorization, database migrations, MVC architecture, modularizing and dividing repeating views into components, various database concepts, CSS, HTML, JS and also other features of Laravel framework. It was a great learning experience and it was a good experience using all the technologies and tools.
