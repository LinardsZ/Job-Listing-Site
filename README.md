# Job Listing Site Project 
This project was made as part of Web Technologies II course requirements. This is my first big project which really sparked my interest in web development and where I made my attempt at making a useful and usable website written in PHP and built on Laravel framework. It is a job listing site where companies are able to sign up and post their job offers and potential employees are able to browse and search for specific job offers. I also implemented a direct messaging feature between regular users and companies.

In this project I implemented and learned about CRUD operations, user login and registration, authentication and authorization, database migrations, MVC architecture, modularizing and dividing repeating views into components, various database concepts, CSS, HTML, JS and also other features of Laravel framework. It was a great learning experience and I had a LOT of fun dealing with the steep learning curves and all the new technologies and tools.
